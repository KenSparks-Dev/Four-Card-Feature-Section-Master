  <h2>Initial Notes</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>Alright so we have 4 cards. One on the left, 2 stacked on top of each other in the middle. There are are a few ways we can do this. We can try to do this </p>
  <ol>
    <li> I can try this all in one row with four equal columns. Try to stack the two in the middle somehow.</li>
    <li> I can try to one row on both the left and the right each with a single card. Then try one row in the middle with two columns</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Other notes:</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>One thing I might want to try using bootstrap cards.</p>
  <p>I can also use use border-top and the colors in the style-guide.</p>
  <p>All the text and stuff is pretty simple so thats good.</p>
  <p>Gonna research the stacking columns thing</p>
